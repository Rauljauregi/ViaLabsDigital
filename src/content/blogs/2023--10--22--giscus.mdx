I added [Giscus](https://giscus.app) to use GitHub Discussions as my comments backends.
This way I can provide interactivity to the blog.

Hopefully people will not use it for spam, because the moderation option is limited.

You can use the posts' frontmatter to enable or disable comments sections.
For example, this post's frontmatter looks like this.

```yaml

layout: blog-post
comments: true

```

Alternatively, you can set the default value of the comments sections using gatsby-theme options.
In your `gatsby-config.js`, provide the option like this:

```js
...
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-theme",
      options: {
        commentsEnabled: true,
        commentsProps: {
          repo: "lucernae/gatsby-starter-lucernae",
          repoId:"R_kgDOKRTVcw",
          category: "Announcements",
          categoryId: "DIC_kwDOKRTVc84CaVF-",
          mapping: "pathname",
          strict: "0",
          reactionsEnabled: "1",
          emitMetadata: "1",
          inputPosition: "top",
          theme: "preferred_color_scheme",
          lang: "en",
          loading: "lazy",
        },
      },
    },
...
```
