# Anchor

```markdown
Anchor is tag used to define link between two objects.

To link into anchor located in the same page, use the slugified heading: [go to heading 1](#heading)

An anchor doesn't have to be a heading.

To define a new anchor, attach an html `id` attribtue to the object: <a id="my-anchor" name="my-anchor-name" href="#my-anchor">this is an anchor</a>.

Then you can link into your own anchor: [go to my anchor](#my-anchor)

You can also uses `name` attribute: [go to my anchor by name](#my-anchor-name)
```

# Block Elements

```markdown
Simply write anything.
If it is still not separated by two line break.
It will count as the same paragraph.

This is a new paragraph.

This is another new paragraph.

Your new line in source code won't matter.
The block will render it as one long sentence.
```

# Blockquotes

```markdown
Block quotes is used as an email/RFC styles of quoting.

Append a new line with `>` sign, and then it will becomes a quoted block.
As long as it doesn't encounter two new lines, the following new line will be treated as the same block quotes

> This is a new line.
> This is another new line inside the same Blockquotes

> This is a different Blockquotes

> You can copy paste block quotes from email,
> where each line has `>` sign.
```

# Code block

Code block, or preformatted blocks is used to show a block you write, as it is, without markdown processing.

Add three backticks before and after the blocks

```
This is a code block

**markdown syntax** will be displayed as it is.

One sentence.
Two sentence.
Three sentence.

1. Numbering
2. Is not
10. automatically incremented
```

You can add syntax highlighting if the renderer supports it. Add the syntax name after the first three backticks
For example, this is a python code:

```python
def my_func():
    print("Hello World")

my_func()
```

You can also syntax highlight Markdown syntax:

```markdown
Bold sentence **is here**
```

Here's the source code of above code blocks (Code block-ception):

````markdown
```

Two sentence.
Three sentence.

# Escaping backticks

Backticks is used to enclose a preformatted character, `like this`.

You also used a code block, before. It uses backticks.

`This is a code block.
And it is displayed as **it is**.`

You most often sees that there are three backticks used for blocks ` ``` `.

```
This is a code block
```

This is because three backticks is used to escape two or one backticks inside a code block.

So, if you want to put text that contains 3 backticks, for example, showing a source of the code blocks,
use 4 backticks or more.

`````markdown
````markdown
Use 4 backticks to escape 3 backticks code blocks

```markdown
My markdown **syntax** example.
```
````

By the way, this also means, this blocks uses 5 backticks in the source code :D.
`````

# Horizontal separator

You can make separator by using three dashes `---` or stars `***` or underscores `___`
