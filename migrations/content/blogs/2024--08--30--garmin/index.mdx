# Garmin FIT file support

This blog provides some supports rendering and embedding Garmin activity data.

# Garmin Embed Link

[Garmin Connect Activity](https://connect.garmin.com) can be embedded if the activity ID is known.

Use MDX directly and pass activityId and Title props

```mdx
<ActivityEmbedViewer activityId={16813834908} title='Indramayu - Long Easy Run'>
```

<ActivityEmbedViewer activityId={16813834908} title='Indramayu - Long Easy Run' />

The iframe above can be clicked to redirect to Garmin Connect page.

# FIT file processing

FIT file is a format standardized for Garmin Activity data.
You can export your FIT file from Garmin Connect webpage, then put it in the content page of your blog.

An example below uses MDX to leverage webpack to import FIT data into the component.
After the static link is generated, it can be passed to `FITDataProvider` component.
You can embed charts/viewer inside the `FITDataProvider` component, and the viewer will try to use FIT data defined by the parent context.
This lets you load FIT data once upon build time, and let several charts refers to the same data.

```mdx
import activity_link from './16813834908_ACTIVITY.fit'

<FITDataProvider fitFile={activity_link}>

    <a href={`${activity_link}`}>Downloadable link to the FIT data, built by webpack</a>

    <HeartRateViewer />
    <PaceViewer />
    <CadenceViewer />

</FITDataProvider>
```

import activity_link from './16813834908_ACTIVITY.fit'

<FITDataProvider fitFile={activity_link}>

    <a href={`${activity_link}`}>Downloadable link to the FIT data, built by webpack</a>

    <HeartRateViewer />
    <PaceViewer />
    <CadenceViewer />

</FITDataProvider>
